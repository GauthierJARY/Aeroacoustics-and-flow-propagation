### Acoustic Propagation

This project aims to study underwater acoustic propagation and analyze the long-distance propagation of wind turbine noise, examining clean rays with and without ground reflection.

### Project Description

This project explores trhee main areas:

**Underwater Acoustic Propagation:** Analysis of context, methodologies, expected results, and the significance of the study. Based on Munk's 1974 profiles, presenting a velocity law in the aquatic medium.<br>
**Long-Distance Propagation of Wind Turbine Noise:** Exploration of clean rays with and without ground reflection, research methodology, results, and conclusions.<br>
**Application to a Research Article:** This project aims to reproduce the results of a study on the impact of wing geometry on acoustic generation, based on experimental data from the anechoic wind tunnel at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. We will use signal processing techniques to analyze profile noise measurements and generate spectrograms with new parameters, including using zero-padding to improve frequency resolution.
